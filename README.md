Explor3r
========

Resource explorer for the **Driv3r** video game inspired by [this thread](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=9897).


## Experimental

This project is still in the early stage of development and makes some pretty bold assumptions on the data format. Also, my research contribution is limited to the official demo.

## Download

Download the current state of the project [here](https://github.com/x1nixmzeng/Explor3r/archive/master.zip).

**NOTE** You will need to extract the whole archive as the DevIL libraries are now required.
