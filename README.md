Explor3r
========

Resource explorer for the **Driv3r** video game inspired by [this thread](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=9897).


## Experimental

This is a very incomplete project with almost no functionality of value. Research is based on the official demo.

## Download

Download the current state of the project [here](https://github.com/x1nixmzeng/Explor3r/archive/master.zip).

**NOTE** You will need to extract the whole archive as the DevIL libraries are now required.
